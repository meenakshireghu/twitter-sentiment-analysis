# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning project that analyzes the sentiment of tweets using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The sentiment analysis model is trained on a dataset of 13,870 tweets collected via the Twitter API. The project aims to classify the sentiment of tweets into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an automated machine learning model that can compute the sentiment (customer perception) based on the provided tweets. The model leverages the **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** method to convert text data into numerical features and uses an **SVM classifier** to predict sentiments.

### Sentiment Labels:
- **Positive**
- **Negative**
- **Neutral**
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
- **Sentiment**: The sentiment of the tweet (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **Text**: The content of the tweet.
